# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Working Directory

## The CORRECT directory for all edits is:
### `snappy-site/`

DO NOT edit files in:
- ❌ `app-old-do-not-use/` (old code, not deployed)
- ❌ `components-old-do-not-use/` (old code, not deployed)
- ❌ `lib-old-do-not-use/` (old code, not deployed)
- ❌ `hooks-old-do-not-use/` (old code, not deployed)

## Vercel Deployment
The Vercel deployment is configured to use `snappy-site` as the root directory.

## Always work in:
```bash
cd snappy-site/
# Make all edits here
```

## To verify you're in the right place:
```bash
pwd
# Should show: /Users/sboulos/Desktop/ai_projects/snappy-website/snappy-site
```
