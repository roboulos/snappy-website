# ⚠️ CRITICAL: ALWAYS WORK IN snappy-site/ FOLDER
- The deployed website is in `snappy-site/` NOT the root folders
- NEVER edit files in root `app-old-do-not-use/` folder
- Always cd into snappy-site/ before making changes
- Vercel deploys from snappy-site/ directory

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
